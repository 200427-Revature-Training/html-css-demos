                <h2>Inline Styling</h2>
                <p style="color: blue">Inline styling is providing styling information inline with 
                    the tag. This is accomplished by using the style attribute
                    and providing any relevant styles using the attribute value.
                </p>
                <p>Inline styles have the highest priority but are the least reusable.
                    Do not use inline styles unless absolutely necessary.</p>

        <li>
            <section>
                <h2>Style Tag</h2>
                <p class="style-tag-rule">The style tag is a tag which can be defined in the document head.
                    This tag can utilize css format styling rules to dictate styles
                    for the current page.</p>
                <p>Style tag usage is more reusable than inline tag names, but still 
                    not the recommended styling mechanism as it is rare to build individual 
                    pages in modern web development.  Style tags are only reusable within the
                    single page and must be maintained and sent with an HTML document.

                <h2>External Stylesheet</h2>
                <p class="external-rule">
                    The external stylesheet method is utilized by using a link tag
                    in the head of the document to load an external .css file to act
                    as the stylesheet for the page.  This stylesheet can be reused
                    between html files making it highly reusable.  Additionally, its
                    a dedicated .css sheet that is not directly embedded into a .html
                    file so it cached and save on network activity. Rules defined in
                    an external stylesheet have the lowest priority.
