<!-- HTML - HyperText Markup Language -->
<!-- HTML is the primary file format used for development of web pages -->
<!-- Your browser reads a HTML document to understand the content and 
structure of a webpage. For this reason, HTML is a language concerned with
structuring the content of a webpage. HTML is a semantic language - its
purpose is to describe the content within. -->

<!-- HTML is based in XML - eXtensible Markup Language -->
<!-- HTML (and XML) are documents that are built using Tags -->

<!-- Tags have an opening and closing tag (the closing indicated with a 
initial /) -->
<!-- Every XML document (and consequently HTML) must have a single ROOT tag.
    All other tags must be utilized within the root. <html> is the root for an
        .html document -->
<!-- This is a tag: -->
<html>
    <!-- Tags can be nested - This structure indicates that that the html
        has a head section within it -->
    <head></head>

    <!-- tag and element - A tag is the syntactic structure that we type
    and is located within the .html document. An element is what the browser
    creates based on these tags - the visual and memory representation. Tags
    are the syntax for creating elements. -->
