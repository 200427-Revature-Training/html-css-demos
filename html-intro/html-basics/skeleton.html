<!-- Any XML document should start with a !DOCTYPE declaration -->
<!-- For html documents, they should always look like this: -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<!-- Root tag of an .html document -->
<html>
    <!-- The html element contains exactly two child tags: -->
    <head>
        <!--  The head contains document meta-data - This is information
        useful for the document but not a part of the document itself - meaning
        that head contnet is not displayed in the webpage -->
    </head>
    <body>
        <!-- Content of the webpage -->
        <!-- Body content is used for display -->
    </body>
</html>
